                    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                    <h6>From this data, we can conclude that it took some time for your friends to find your new Instagram account, but there was gradual growth in your follower count over the course of a month. The initial week saw some growth, followed by a period of stagnation, and then another increase in followers.</h6>
                    <h6>However, it's important to keep in mind that the growth of an Instagram account depends on various factors, including how actively you engage with the platform, the quality of your content, and whether you actively promote your account to friends and contacts through other means (such as sharing your username on other social media platforms or directly with friends). Additionally, Instagram's algorithm may also play a role in how your account is discovered by others.</h6>
