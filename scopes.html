                <h2>Scope Of Study</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li class="left" class="bullet1"><h5>How do people behave online? Polite or aggressive?</h5></li>
                        <li class="bullet2"><p>Nowadays, communication is more convenient, and everyone can register an account on social media for free with one click. However, this has also resulted in the emergence of some anonymous accounts due to users' personal habits. Some people will use this account peacefully, while others will use it for bullying purposes. In this study, we are going to observe users behaviour in difference social media applications.</p></li>
                    <li class="left" class="bullet1"><h5>With the same topic, which platform can gain more interest for the viewers?</h5></li>
                        <li class="bullet2"><p>In this technological era, many social media applications with different functions have emerged due to business opportunities. They each attract different users, including influencers and e-commerce companies. In this study, we will find out which apps get more views from viewers and are better suited for these specific users.</p></li>
                    <li class="left" class="bullet1"><h5>Which social media is least famous or most famous, and which app did users commonly prefer to use?</h5></li>
                        <li class="bullet2"><p>As we mentioned in scope 2, due to business opportunities, many social media applications with different functions have emerged, bringing profits to them. However, which social media application is more familiar to users? And which social media applications do users generally prefer to use?</p></li>
                    <li class="left" class="bullet1"><h5>How long does it take for friends to find our new account?</h5></li>
                        <li class="bullet2"><p>As we mentioned in scope 1, everyone can now easily register an account on a social media application. However, believe each of us has heard of incidents where certain apps can track our private information. So, in this study, we will do an experiment to see if friends can find our new account without us contacting them.</p></li>
